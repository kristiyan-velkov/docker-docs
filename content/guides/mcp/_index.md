This MCP (Modern Containerized Practices) guide shows how to containerize a React.js application using Docker, embracing modern development workflows, robust DevOps practices, and scalable deployment strategies.

[React.js](https://react.dev/) is one of the most popular libraries for building interactive UIs. While it's powerful on the front-end, scaling it in production environments and maintaining consistent development pipelines can be complex. MCP simplifies this through containerization, automation, and orchestration.

## ðŸ“˜ What You Will Learn

By the end of this guide, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Containerize a React.js application using Docker for MCP workflows.
- Create a local development setup using Docker volumes and hot reloading.
- Run tests inside containers for consistency across environments.
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate builds and deployments.
- Deploy to a local Kubernetes cluster for reliable testing and debugging under MCP practices.

Letâ€™s begin with containerizing your React.js app.

## âœ… Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have a working knowledge of:

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)
- React.js fundamentals
- Docker concepts like images, containers, and Dockerfiles  
  > If you're new to Docker, begin with the [Docker basics](/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container.md) guide.

Once you're familiar with these fundamentals, youâ€™re ready to dive into containerizing a React.js application using MCP best practices.
